The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error where the specificity of selectors unexpectedly overrides expected styling:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container p {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

p.special {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.container p.special {
  background-color: lightyellow;
}
```

In this example, one might expect the paragraph with class "special" inside the container to have a background color of "lightcoral".  However, because the selector ".container p.special" is more specific, it will override the style set by "p.special", resulting in a lightyellow background instead. This is unexpected if one assumed a simple cascade would work and the most specific selector would always take precedence regardless of order.
