# CSS Specificity Issue: Unexpected Selector Override

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue related to CSS specificity that can lead to unexpected styling results.  The problem arises from the way CSS selectors are evaluated and the sometimes counter-intuitive behavior of specificity.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, and `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected approach.

## Bug Description

The bug showcases how a less general selector can be overridden by a more specific selector even if it appears later in the stylesheet. This can be confusing when managing complex styles.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates various ways to handle specificity issues, such as reordering selectors or using more specific selectors in the desired order to achieve the intended styling.  Careful consideration of selector specificity is crucial for writing maintainable and predictable CSS.
